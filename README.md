# 🩺 Personalized Medicine Recommendation System using Machine Learning

The **Personalized Medicine Recommendation System** is a machine learning–based application designed to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms and recommend suitable medicines, diets, and precautions. The system helps in making faster and more personalized healthcare decisions by leveraging data-driven models.

## 📌 Project Description

In traditional healthcare systems, identifying the correct disease and medication based on symptoms can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms entered by users and predict the most likely disease. Based on the predicted disease, the system recommends appropriate medicines, dietary suggestions, and precautionary measures.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare and serves as a strong academic and portfolio project.
